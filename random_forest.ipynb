Recap
Here's the code you've written so far.

In [ ]:
# Code you have previously used to load data
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Path of the file to read
iowa_file_path = '/content/train.csv'

# Create X
features = ['LotArea', 'YearBuilt', '1stFlrSF', '2ndFlrSF', 'FullBath', 'BedroomAbvGr', 'TotRmsAbvGrd']
X = home_data[features]

# Split into validation and training data
train_X, val_X, train_y, val_y = train_test_split(X, y, random_state=1)

# Specify Model
iowa_model = DecisionTreeRegressor(random_state=1)
# Fit Model
iowa_model.fit(train_X, train_y)

# Make validation predictions and calculate mean absolute error

Exercises
Data science isn't always this easy. But replacing the decision tree with a Random Forest is going to be an easy win.

In [ ]:
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor

# Define the model. Set random_state to 1
rf_model = RandomForestRegressor(random_state=1)

# fit your model
rf_model.fit(train_X, train_y)

# Calculate the mean absolute error of your Random Forest model on the validation data

rf_val_predictions = rf_model.predict(val_X)
rf_val_mae = mean_absolute_error(rf_val_predictions, val_y)
print("Validation MAE for Random Forest Model: {}".format(rf_val_mae))

# Check your answer
step_1.check()
Validation MAE for Random Forest Model: 21857.15912981083
<IPython.core.display.Javascript object>

So far, you have followed specific instructions at each step of your project. This helped learn key ideas and build your first model, but now you know enough to try things on your own.

Machine Learning competitions are a great way to try your own ideas and learn more as you independently navigate a machine learning project.

Keep Going
You are ready for Machine Learning Competitions.
